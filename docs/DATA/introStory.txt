Welcome adventurer! It appears that you have been summoned to The Spire.
I do not envy you adventurer, but I wish you luck one your journey, it will not
be an easy one...

You see, this spire has been a mystery for centuries. Not lost to time, or 
shadowed in mystery, rather, one day it just appeared. The druids lost their 
lives and the forest where they lived was completly desolated. Ripped appart. 
The blased lands you can see before you is all that remains. 

They say an old wizard was trying to move his castle into another dimension, 
but something went horibly wrong, and the ritual moved a part of that world 
into ours...
	And it has never been the same since...

For as long as time can remember the spire has taken the lives of our loved.
Turning their souls into nothing more than empty, greed filled shells of 
what they once were. Everyone who enters the spire turns into a shadow of 
themselfs. Hell, shadow may be generious. They become... Well... You'll see.

Anyways adventurer, where do you come from? I can't quite place you:
