Welcome adventurer! It appears that you have been summoned to The Spire.
I do not envy you adventurer, but I wish you luck one your journey, it will not
be an easy one...

You see, this spire has been a mystery for centuries. Not lost to time, or
shadowed in mystery, rather, one day it just appeared. The druids lost their
lives, and their forest. It was completely desomated... Ripped apart.
The blasted lands you can see before you is all that remains.

They say an old wizard was trying to move his castle into another dimension,
but something went horribly wrong, and the ritual moved a part of that world
into ours...
    And it has never been the same since...

For all that time can remember, the spire takes the lives of our loved ones.
Turning their souls into nothing more than empty, greed ridden shadows of 
themselfs. Hell, shadows may be generous. 
	They become... 
		      Well... 
			     You'll see.
